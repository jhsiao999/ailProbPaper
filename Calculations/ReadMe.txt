---------
Simulation code, not really used in paper but makes me more
comfortable with the theoretical results

cross_func.R                R code for simulating meiosis and RI lines

diversity_outcross.R        Calculations regarding the DO
diversity_outcross_sims.R   Simulate the DO  [SUB gets replaced by an integer]
sims.R                      More DO simulations

dosim_comparisons.R         R code to compare the simulation results
                            to the theoretical results

sim_ail.R                   simulate AIL
sim_ail_cluster.R           simulate AIL on the cluster
